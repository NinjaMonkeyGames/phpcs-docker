## What is this repository for? ##

The purpose of this repository is to maintain control over versions of PHPCS. This maintains uniformity when enforcing
coding standards and formatting rules. This allows for easier upgrades and prevents newer versions from breaking the
pipeline.

---

## Configuration information ##

There is a 'phpcs.xml' file containing the PHPCS configuration in the root of the project directory. You can use the
following YAML line to copy this into your project directory.

```shell
cp /app/phpcs.xml $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
```

Alternately you can use the following command to use your own configuration file.

```shell
run: phpcs --colors --standard=phpcs.xml .
```

See links below for more information about PHPCS and Alpine Linux.
